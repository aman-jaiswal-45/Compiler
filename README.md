# Hydrogen Lang (CPP Compiler)

Hydrogen is a Hobby programming language. It is called Hydrogen because it is simple, lightweight, and will catch on
fire if handled improperlyðŸ”¥

This compiler is written in C++ but hopefully it will get to a point where it can be self-hosted.

Executable will be `hydro` in the `build/` directory.
